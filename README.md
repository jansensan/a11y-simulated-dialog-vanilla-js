Demo of an accessible simulated dialog (modal) in vanilla JS.


## How to use

### Screen Readers

Some parts of the project require the use of a [screen reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader). The subject of screen readers is broader than this project intends to approach, so you will have to research and read about that subject on your own.

In the meantime, here are a few links to some screen readers.

- [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/): Windows only. Free: open source.
- [Jaws](http://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/Blindness/JAWS): Windows only. Expensive: ranging from ~$180 (90 day license) to ~$1100 (pro version).
- [VoiceOver](http://www.apple.com/ca/accessibility/mac/vision/): macOS and iOS only. Free: built into the OS.


This project is tested with NVDA on a Windows 10 environment.
